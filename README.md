# UTF8 Implementation

- In this repository contains the code I have written to understand how UTF-8 encoding works. 
- Test files contains core UTF-8 tests.
- While working on this repository, I got to know significant amount of encoding implementation like UTF-16, High and Low surrogates, Big Endian etc.
- Great excercise to implement UTF-8 encoding.
